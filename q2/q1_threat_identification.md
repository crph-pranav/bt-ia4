# i. Identified Security Threats for Layer 2 Blockchains

| **Layer** | **Threat** | **Description** |
|------------|-------------|------------------|
| **Transaction Layer** | **Double-Spending Attack** | An attacker attempts to spend the same token or transaction output more than once by exploiting finality delays or consensus weaknesses. |
| **Network Layer** | **Sybil Attack** | Multiple fake nodes are created by an attacker to influence consensus or disrupt network communication. |
| **Application Layer** | **Smart Contract Exploit** | Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in smart contract code (e.g., reentrancy, access control flaws, integer overflow) to manipulate or drain funds. |

**Summary:**  
These three threats—Double-Spending, Sybil, and Smart Contract Exploits—represent the most significant risks to Layer 2 blockchain financial systems, affecting integrity, availability, and trust.
